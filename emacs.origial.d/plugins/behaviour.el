;; Sometimes, i want to recover a certain window configuration in a
;; quick way.  Use Emacs normally, and whenever one cherished window
;; layout gets destroyed, press C-c <left> (where <left> refers to the
;; left cursor key) to recover itâ€“actually, this calls winner-undo,
;; and you can invoke it as many times as you want to visit previous
;; window configurations. As one would expect, C-c <right> (the
;; default binding for winner-redo) navigates configurations in the
;; opposite direction. Simple and very useful, as it should be.
