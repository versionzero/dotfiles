# I keep forgetting that on OS X, strace does not exist; so instead of
# learning that lesson, I'm just going to stn an alias to dtruss until
# such a time comes that I no longer forget and actually type dtruss,
# like I eventually did in the case of cls.
#
# And, yes, I should just be using dtrace :)
